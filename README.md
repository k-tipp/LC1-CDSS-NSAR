# LC1-CDSS-NSAR

This is a student project of the medical informatics department of the Bern University of Applied Science.

Target was to create a simple application to implement custom CDSS rules in a clinical environment. To achive this we developed a extendable Application which allows to inject validator classes from external jars on startup.
